You can send the code in any way you would consider appropriate.
Throughout the process, please write down and keep your questions regarding this task.
Do you have any comments on the data/results?

1. write an SQL query that sums up reading for horror readers by day.
- how much did they read?
- how many readers are there?
- what country are the readers from?
2. write the same query in Python and possibly with Pandas or Numpy; or write it in R if you feel more comfortable.
3. the Stories table contains a field called 'Teaser'. How would you extract geographic location from this?
